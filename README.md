# World Bank Dashboard - Frontend ü•ê

World Bank Dashboard is a prototype for the World Bank and their World Development Indicators. 

This data consists of a vast magnitude of information that the World Bank knows about every country in the world and which relates to the economic development for each country. The data for the indicators are updated annually. 

* To access our services, users will be required to create an account and log in. They will then be taken to a search page, in which they can select one or two countries:
* If two countries are selected, users are then required to select an indicator and a year range
  * When enquiring a range of years, the results will be represented by a superimposed line graph, where each line represents each country selected
  * When enquiring a specific year, the results will be represented by a numerical value for each country
* If one country is selected, users will be able to leave the indicator section blank, which will return the results for all indicators of that country

* Finally, users will have access to their search history with the time and date of enquiry, along with the option to view the data for the enquiry made.


This folder specifically contains all of the frontend functionality and what the user sees, including the React app and its components.
